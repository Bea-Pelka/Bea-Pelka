**Tech Professional and Creative Person - Developer | Designer**







> [!IMPORTANT]
> :small_orange_diamond: I am a beginner who is I'm currently learning how to code. By the beginning of the year I started to dive into HTML, CSS and now I'm currently learning Javascript. 
I have been working as an autonomous Designer for about 5 years, and through my studies and experience with inumerous applications I found myself wishing to be less dependable of tools that were limitating my creativity and capabilities - **that's when I started to actually _venture_ myself writing some code snippets here and there**, since then I discovered a _new opportunity_ for me. Now my main goal is to become a Dev, we'll see where this takes me.
